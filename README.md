# Messages from Teton's fleet - visualized

This is a cute visualization of messages coming from the devices of [Teton.ai](https://teton.ai) in the wild.

Each ping is a message sent by one of the devices. The messages are transmitted using the MQTT protocol, which are caught in the backend component. The client is notified about new messages via a websocket connection. The visualization is using [p5.js](https://p5js.org).
